# GUI-wifi-cracker
Would you like to be able to extract WPA/WPA2 handshakes from FlipperZero's captured .pcap files, and analyze them with hashcat, and find out passwords JUST IN ONE CLICK?

This is the GUI (Graphic User Interface) version of my other script and repo [`flipperzero-CLI-wifi-cracker`](https://github.com/grugnoymeme/flipperzero-CLI-wifi-cracker), i just wanted to make the process easyest as possible, and this is the result.  
         

### BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

```
cd dictionary/brutefoce_attack

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you've connected the devboard and opened the app,follow these instructions:
